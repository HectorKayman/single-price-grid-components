## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5.
- CSS Grid.
- CSS3: For styling and layout of the content.
- Google Fonts: The 'Karla' font was imported from Google Fonts to enhance typography.

### What I learned

During the development of this project, I learned several important concepts:

- Semantic HTML: Proper use of semantic HTML elements like `<header>`, `<main>`, and `<section>` for structuring the content.
- CSS Variables: Use of CSS variables to define and manage color, font family, and other properties.
- Grid Layout: Implementation of a grid layout for the main content section, defining areas for different parts of the page.
- Responsive Design: Creation of media queries for different screen sizes to ensure a responsive layout that adapts to varying devices.

### Continued development

In future iterations of this project, I plan to enhance the following areas:

- Accessibility: Improve accessibility by implementing ARIA roles and attributes and ensuring keyboard navigation is seamless.
- Mobile-First Design: Develop the project with a mobile-first approach for better responsiveness on small screens.
- JavaScript Interaction: Add interactive elements to the page using JavaScript, such as form validation and dynamic content.

### Useful resources

During the development process, the following resources were found helpful:

- [Grid Garden](https://cssgridgarden.com/): An invaluable resource learning CSS Grid
- [CSS-Tricks](https://css-tricks.com/): A web development community with articles, guides, and forums on CSS and related technologies.
